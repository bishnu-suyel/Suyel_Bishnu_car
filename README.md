# Car Register Unit Testing with Node.js & Jest

### Description
This project is a part of assignment that focuses on unit testing using the Jest framework and Node.js. It revolves around testing various functionalities related to a default array of cars, such as retrieving the price of a car by a given key, fetching the color(s) of a car, and verifying other car-related properties. The project is designed to help developers understand how to implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code and its functionalities.

### Target Audience
The project is aimed at developers who want to enhance their skills in:

- Unit testing using Jest.
- Node.js backend development.
- Working with arrays and data structures.
Purpose
- The project was created to demonstrate how to effectively apply unit testing in real-world projects. It serves as a learning tool for anyone interested in ensuring the reliability of their codebase through rigorous testing practices.

### Technologies Used
Built with:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- Jest: A delightful JavaScript testing framework focused on simplicity.
- JavaScript (ES6): The core language used in the project.

### Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bis10/Suyel_Bishnu_car.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the tests using Jest:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

4. To customize the tests or the car array, modify the data or test files located in the `__tests__` directory.
